~A Joke~
Lost in feeling.
Being who I am,
while in the process of becoming.
There&rsquo;s a path forward,
which promises every coward

Again for every coward,
turning him into a joke,
that everyone loves to poke.
Remember, he&rsquo;s a joke.
Not a failure.">

<p>My first serious attempt at poetry, not too bad.</p>
<p>~<strong>A Joke</strong>~</p>
<p>Lost in feeling.</p>
<p>Being who I am,</p>
<p>while in the process of becoming.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a path forward,</p>
<p>which promises every coward</p>
<p>to throw away his timidity</p>
<p>and mold him into an identity.</p>
<p>But there stays a path backward,</p>
<p>Again for every coward,</p>
<p>turning him into a joke,</p>
<p>that everyone loves to poke.</p>
<p>Remember, he&rsquo;s a joke.</p>
<p>Not a failure.</p>
<p>Because he didn&rsquo;t fail,</p>
<p>just couldn&rsquo;t appear.</p>
<p>A score of kids</p>
<p>waiting before the screen.</p>
<p>To show themselves</p>
<p>and live their dream.</p>
<p>Some are placid</p>
<p>while others timid.</p>
<p>Now, who&rsquo;s the unlucky kid?</p>
<p>The one who stumbled,</p>
<p>or the one who couldn&rsquo;t proceed?</p>
<p>No. It&rsquo;s a hopeful child</p>
<p>with a wandering heart.</p>
<p>Searching his name,</p>
<p>amidst the maddening crowd.</p>
<p>He has faith he will hear it</p>
<p>but also haunts himif anyone remembers it.</p>
<p>Eyes that suspend him</p>
<p>Making him ask himself:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why is the world so grim?&rsquo;</p>
<p>We say a poor child,</p>
<p>but do we see his wound?</p>
<p>It is a joy to hide,</p>
<p>but a disaster not to be found.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the path,</p>
<p>to be a joke.</p>
<p>Everyone laughs,</p>
<p>while the child fights to cope.</p>
