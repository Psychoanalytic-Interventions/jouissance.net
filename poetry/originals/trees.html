~Trees On a Cloudy Day~~
Trees on a cloudy day,
are part of a game.
Sun appears for a oment,
only to be shushed by the shade.
Trees on a cloudy day,
open their minds to the sky.
Gently letting the breeze
to hold and feel the sway.

<p>Just something I wrote on a Sunday, sitting near the balcony and watching the trees respond to rain and sun.</p>
<p>~<strong>Trees On a Cloudy Day</strong>~~</p>
<p>Trees on a cloudy day,</p>
<p>are part of a game.</p>
<p>Sun appears for a oment,</p>
<p>only to be shushed by the shade.</p>
<p>Trees on a cloudy day,</p>
<p>open their minds to the sky.</p>
<p>Gently letting the breeze</p>
<p>to hold and feel the sway.</p>
<p>Trees on a cloudy day,</p>
<p>have a peculiar aura and feel.</p>
<p>Not denying the sun, shade or rain</p>
<p>they fully immerse in the play.</p>
<p>Sitting outside on a cloudy day,</p>
<p>flinching as the sun finds me</p>
<p>and exhaling as shade takes over</p>
<p>I look at the trees, imagining</p>
<p>they have something to say.</p>
<p>But, trees on a cloudy day</p>
<p>don&rsquo;t really have anything to say.</p>
<p>I sit with this epiphany.</p>
<p>Taking a pledge</p>
<p>to never hold or deny an experience,</p>
<p>for sake of some destiny.</p>
<p>And opening my mind to the sky,</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s life. I feel the breeze</p>
<p>caressing my sweat, as I step</p>
<p>into the playground where</p>
<p>trees play on a cloudy day.</p>
